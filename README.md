# About the E-commerce Application
This is a multivendor e-commerce application. User authentication is implemented using a custom JWT token-based authentication scheme, diverging from Django's default session-based authentication. All APIs have been tested and are functioning correctly. The UI development for the Login and Register pages is complete; however, the integration between the backend and frontend is still pending.

# Redux Store
This application uses Redux Toolkit for managing state and fetching data from backend APIs efficiently and with simplified code.
