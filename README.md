### About Ecommerce Application
This is a multivendor ecommerce application. So far, user authentication has been implemented using a custom JWT token-based authentication scheme, which differs from Django's default session-based authentication. All APIs have been tested and are functioning correctly. Currently, work is ongoing to develop the user interface.
